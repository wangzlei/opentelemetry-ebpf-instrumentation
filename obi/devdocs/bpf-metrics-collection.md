# BPF metrics collection

The BPF metrics collector reports execution statistics for eBPF programs and
entry counts for eBPF LRU hash maps loaded on the host.

The collector is host-wide. Every collection walks the kernel's complete
program ID namespace from the beginning, so it captures all existing probes of
the supported program types, including probes that were not loaded by OBI. A
later collection also discovers probes loaded after the collector started.

## Supported kernel objects

The collector reports programs with these eBPF program types:

- `Kprobe`
- `SocketFilter`
- `SchedCLS`
- `SkMsg`
- `SockOps`

It reports entry counts only for `LRUHash` maps. Other program and map types are
still encountered during the host-wide walks, but they are not emitted as
metrics.

## Collection paths

BPF metrics can be collected through either of these paths:

- The Prometheus BPF collector is active when a Prometheus endpoint is enabled
  and the `ebpf` metrics feature is selected.
- The internal metrics collector is active when
  `internal_metrics.bpf_metric_scrape_interval` is greater than zero. The
  configured internal reporter exports the collected values through
  Prometheus or OpenTelemetry.

If both paths are active, each path owns a separate collector.

### Prometheus collector metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bpf_probe_latency_seconds` | Histogram | `probe_id`, `probe_type`, `probe_name` |
| `bpf_map_entries_total` | Counter | `map_id`, `map_name`, `map_type`, `max_entries` |

### Internal metrics

| Prometheus metric | OpenTelemetry metric | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `obi_bpf_probe_executions_total` | *(none: see `obi.bpf.probe.latency` count)* | Probe executions |
| `obi_bpf_probe_latency_seconds_total` | `obi.bpf.probe.latency` | Probe latency distribution in seconds |
| `obi_bpf_map_entries` | `obi.bpf.map.entries` | Current map entry count |
| `obi_bpf_map_max_entries` | `obi.bpf.map.max_entries` | Configured maximum map entries |

Probe metrics use the program ID, type, and function name as attributes or
labels. Map metrics use the map ID, type, and name.

## Program discovery and statistics

The collector enables kernel BPF runtime statistics for its lifetime so that
accounting continues between collections. Each collection walks every program
ID and reads `Stats()` from every supported program. Metadata is cached when a
program is first observed. Each supported program is opened temporarily to read
its statistics and closed before collection continues. Unsupported program
types are cached without retaining their handles.

The collector reports execution-count and runtime changes between collections
and derives probe latency by dividing the runtime change by the execution-count
change. Runtime statistics are disabled when the collector shuts down.

## Map discovery and entry counting

Each collection walks every map ID and caches metadata for newly observed maps.
For each `LRUHash` map, it opens a temporary handle, iterates the entries to
count them, and closes the handle. Missing metadata entries are removed after a
complete ID walk.
