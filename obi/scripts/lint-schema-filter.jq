# Filters `weaver registry check` JSON diagnostics down to the ones that must
# fail `make lint-schema`, removing only the expected findings below. Weaver
# has no first-class override mechanism between a registry and its
# dependencies yet, nor a CLI flag to suppress the duplicate checks, while
# `registry live-check` resolves each duplicate in the local group's favor.
# Tracked in https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver/issues/1578; when
# weaver defines override semantics this filter (and the override groups
# documented in schemas/obi/README.md) can be dropped.
#
# 1. UnstableFileFormat we accept UnstableFileFormat for "definition/2" due to the migration process.
#
# 2. DuplicateAttributeId for the attribute overrides in
#    `schemas/obi/groups/` (see schemas/obi/README.md): each re-declares an
#    upstream attribute (from group `registry.<ns>`, under the distinct group
#    id `x.obi.<ns>`) — either an enum extended with the values OBI
#    intentionally emits, or an open-ended enum re-typed as string.
#
# 3. DeprecatedIncludeUnreferencedWarning: weaver 0.25 deprecated the
#    `--include-unreferenced` flag, which OBI still needs — its override and
#    marker groups are standalone (not referenced by a signal), so without it
#    they drop out of resolution. `--future` promotes the deprecation to an
#    error; accept it until OBI migrates to explicit `import:` statements.
#
# Any other diagnostic — including duplicates for other metrics/attributes,
# or the expected ones with unexpected provenances/groups — is kept and fails
# the lint. Covered by scripts/lint_schema_filter_test.go.
