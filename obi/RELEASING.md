# Release Process

For the project's versioning and stability policy, including how OBI versions unstable surfaces today and stable surfaces in the future, see [VERSIONING.md](./VERSIONING.md).

## Pre-Release

First, decide which module sets will be released and update their versions in `versions.yaml`.
Commit this change to a new branch (i.e. `release-vX.X.X`).

Update all crosslink dependencies and any version references in code.

1. Run the `prerelease` make target.

   ```console
   make prerelease MODSET=<module set>
   ```

   For example, to prepare a release for the `obi` module set, run:

   ```console
   make prerelease MODSET=obi
   ```

   This will create a branch `prerelease_<module set>_<new tag>` that will contain all release changes.

2. Verify the changes.

    ```console
    git diff ...prerelease_<module set>_<new tag>
    ```

    This should have changed the version for all modules to be `<new tag>`, if there are any crosslink dependencies.

    If these changes look correct, merge them into your pre-release branch:

    ```console
    git merge prerelease_<module set>_<new tag>
    ```

3. Push the changes to upstream and create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Tag

Once the Pull Request with all the version changes has been approved and merged it is time to tag the merged commit.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
> [!CAUTION]
> It is critical you use the same tag that you used in the Pre-Release step!
> Failure to do so will leave things in a broken state.
> As long as you do not change `versions.yaml` between pre-release and this step, things should be fine.

> [!CAUTION]
> [There is currently no way to remove an incorrectly tagged version of a Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34189).
> It is critical you make sure the version you push upstream is correct.
> [Failure to do so will lead to minor emergencies and tough to work around](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/issues/331).

> [!NOTE]
> The tag must follow the format `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-suffix` (e.g., `v1.2.3` or `v1.2.3-rc1`), where X, Y, and Z are numbers. The release workflow will only trigger on tags matching this pattern.
> When the tag is pushed, the release workflow will automatically run the full test suite as composed workflows before creating a draft release.
> If any tests fail or don't complete, the release will not be created.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD028 -->

1. For each module set that will be released, run the `add-tags` make target using the `<commit-hash>` of the commit on the main branch for the merged Pull Request.

   ```console
   make add-tags MODSET=<module set> COMMIT=<commit hash>
   ```

   For example, to add tags for the `obi` module set for the latest commit, run:

   ```console
   make add-tags MODSET=obi
   ```

   It should only be necessary to provide an explicit `COMMIT` value if the
   current `HEAD` of your working directory is not the correct commit.

2. Push tags to the upstream remote (not your fork: `github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go.git`).
   Make sure you push all sub-modules as well.

   ```console
   git push upstream <new tag>
   git push upstream <submodules-path/new tag>
   ...
   ```

## Release

### Automatic Release Workflow

When you push a tag matching the pattern `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v1.2.3`) or `vX.Y.Z-suffix` (e.g., `v1.2.3-rc1`), where X, Y, and Z are numbers, the release workflow will automatically:

1. **Validate Tag Format**: Ensures the tag follows the required format (`v*.*.*` with optional pre-release suffix).

2. **Run Full Test Suite**: The workflow runs all required CI checks in parallel as composed workflows:
   - Unit tests and verification checks
   - Integration tests
   - K8s integration tests
   - OATS tests
   - VM integration tests
   - ARM integration tests
   - Java agent tests
   - Docker build tests
   - Clang format checking
   - Clang tidy linting

   If any of these checks fail or don't complete, the release workflow will fail and no draft release will be created.

3. **Build Release Artifacts**: Once all checks pass, the workflow builds multi-architecture release artifacts:
   - Runs `make release` to generate versioned tarballs for amd64 and arm64
   - Archives contain: `obi`, LICENSE, NOTICE, and NOTICES/ directory
   - Builds a custom source archive from the exact tagged source snapshot plus generated artifacts (including bpf2go outputs)
   - Generates one CycloneDX SBOM per release archive
   - Generates a dedicated CycloneDX SBOM for the embedded Java agent to capture its Java dependency graph
   - Generates SHA256 checksums for all uploaded release archives and SBOM assets
   - Verifies archive contents, binary executability, and SBOM structure

4. **Create Draft Release**: A draft release is automatically created with:
   - Auto-generated release notes from GitHub
   - Multi-architecture tarballs: `obi-v<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz` and `obi-v<version>-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
   - Source+generated archive: `obi-v<version>-source-generated.tar.gz`
   - CycloneDX SBOMs for each archive:
     `obi-v<version>-linux-amd64.cyclonedx.json`,
     `obi-v<version>-linux-arm64.cyclonedx.json`,
     and `obi-v<version>-source-generated.cyclonedx.json`
   - Java agent CycloneDX SBOM:
     `obi-java-agent-v<version>.cyclonedx.json`
   - Checksum file: `SHA256SUMS` covering the release archives and SBOM assets

   The draft release allows maintainers to review artifacts before publication.

### Reviewing, Editing, and Publishing the Draft Release

Once the workflow completes successfully, a draft release is automatically created with auto-generated release notes from GitHub, which includes a list of changes since the previous release.

1. Navigate to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation/releases)
2. Locate the draft release for your version
3. Review the artifacts:
   - Download and verify checksums for the release artifacts you fetched: `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS`
   - Confirm checksum verification reports `OK` for every downloaded asset that was checked before publication
   - Verify the Cosign signatures for every release archive, SBOM, and the checksum file. Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the release tag:

     ```console
     set -e

     release_tag=vX.Y.Z
     repository=open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation
     certificate_identity="https://github.com/${repository}/.github/workflows/release.yml"
     certificate_identity="${certificate_identity}@refs/tags/${release_tag}"
     release_dir="$(mktemp -d)"

     gh release download "${release_tag}" \
       --repo "${repository}" \
       --dir "${release_dir}" \
       --pattern '*.tar.gz' \
       --pattern '*.cyclonedx.json' \
       --pattern SHA256SUMS \
       --pattern '*.bundle.json'

     for artifact in \
       "${release_dir}"/*.tar.gz \
       "${release_dir}"/*.cyclonedx.json \
       "${release_dir}"/SHA256SUMS; do
       cosign verify-blob "${artifact}" \
         --bundle "${artifact}.bundle.json" \
         --certificate-identity "${certificate_identity}" \
         --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'
     done

     rm -rf "${release_dir}"
     ```

     Every `cosign verify-blob` command must report `Verified OK`.
   - Extract archives and test binaries if needed
   - Open the published CycloneDX SBOMs with your preferred SBOM tooling if you want to inspect release dependencies
   - Use the dedicated Java agent SBOM when you need the full Java dependency graph for the JAR embedded inside `obi`
   - Verify signed container images from both registries before publication:
     `cosign verify --certificate-identity 'https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation/.github/workflows/publish_dockerhub_main.yml@refs/tags/<tag>' --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' otel/ebpf-instrument:<tag>`
   - Verify the matching GHCR image as well:
     `cosign verify --certificate-identity 'https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation/.github/workflows/publish_dockerhub_main.yml@refs/tags/<tag>' --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation/ebpf-instrument:<tag>`
   - Review auto-generated release notes for accuracy
   - When the supported configuration contract changes, link the
     [Config v1 to v2 migration guide](devdocs/config/version-2.0/migration.md)
     and state:
     - the first release that can load the new version in standalone and
       Collector receiver modes;
     - whether the previous configuration version remains supported;
     - any migration limitations that affect compatibility.
   - Link those release notes back from the
     [Config v2 release gate](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation/issues/2251)
     and the
     [stable v1.0 release epic](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation/issues/1133)
     before publishing the release.
4. Edit release notes if necessary to add context, highlight important changes, or improve clarity
5. Once satisfied with artifacts and release notes, click "Publish release" to make it immutable and publicly available

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once published, GitHub releases are immutable. Artifacts and checksums cannot be modified or replaced. Review carefully before publishing.

### User Documentation To Keep In Sync

When release artifact names, verification commands, or installation steps change,
update the user-facing docs in both places before or alongside the release:

- Repository quick-start guide: [README.md](README.md)
- Repository [Config v1 to v2 migration guide](devdocs/config/version-2.0/migration.md)
- OpenTelemetry [docs for standalone installs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/setup/standalone/)
- OpenTelemetry [docs for container installs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/setup/docker/)

### Archive Contents

Each release archive (`obi-v<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`) contains:

- `obi`: Main OBI binary
- `LICENSE`: Apache 2.0 license file
- `NOTICE`: Legal notices
- `NOTICES/`: Directory with third-party licenses and attributions

The release also includes a custom source archive, `obi-v<version>-source-generated.tar.gz`, which contains:

- Source files from the exact tagged revision
- Generated artifacts produced by the release generation pipeline (including bpf2go-generated `.go` and `.o` outputs and the Java agent JAR `obi-java-agent.jar`)

### Building Release Artifacts Locally

To test the release artifact generation locally before tagging:

```console
make release GOARCH=amd64
make release GOARCH=arm64
make release-source
```

This will:

1. Build artifacts for both amd64 and arm64 architectures
2. Build a source+generated archive from the current release version ref
3. Verify archive contents
4. Generate a single `SHA256SUMS` file for all `obi-v<version>-*.tar.gz` release archives and SBOM assets

The `dist/` directory will contain:

- `obi-v<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
- `obi-v<version>-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- `obi-v<version>-source-generated.tar.gz`
- `obi-v<version>-linux-amd64.cyclonedx.json`
- `obi-v<version>-linux-arm64.cyclonedx.json`
- `obi-v<version>-source-generated.cyclonedx.json`
- `obi-java-agent-v<version>.cyclonedx.json`
- `SHA256SUMS`

### Manual Release Trigger

If you need to re-trigger the release workflow (for example, if the workflow previously failed due to a temporary issue), dispatch it from the release tag:

```console
release_tag=vX.Y.Z
gh workflow run release.yml \
  --repo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-instrumentation \
  --ref "${release_tag}" \
  --raw-field tag="${release_tag}" \
  --raw-field latest=false
```

Using the release tag for `--ref` is required. Dispatching from the default branch would give the signed artifacts a `refs/heads/main` certificate identity instead of the `refs/tags/${release_tag}` identity required by the verification command above.

The manual trigger will validate the tag format, run the full test suite, and create a draft release with the same requirements as the automatic trigger.

## Post-Release

The Helm chart version is automatically updated by CI.

The releaser must update the OBI version references in the
[OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/).
