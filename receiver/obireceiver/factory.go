// Package obireceiver is the CloudWatch Agent entry point for the ADOT-patched
// OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation (OBI).
//
// It is a thin wrapper over OBI's own collector receiver
// (go.opentelemetry.io/obi/collector): the create functions, the shared
// traces/metrics controller and the eBPF pipeline are OBI's. What this package
// adds are CloudWatch-Agent-friendly defaults (see defaults_linux.go) and
// receiver-mode validation. On platforms OBI does not support the factory
// still registers (so cwagent's component list is identical on every OS) but
// creating the receiver fails with OBI's "unsupported platform" error.
package obireceiver // import "github.com/aws-observability/adot-obi/receiver/obireceiver"
